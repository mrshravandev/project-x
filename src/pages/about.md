# About Me â€” Shravan C (@mrshravandev)

HeyðŸ‘‹, I'm shravan, I am a seasoned softwared engineer based in Bangalore, India with over 7 years of full-time work experience and have designed, developed and shipped various products across platform engineering, industrial edge & IoT, home retail e-commerce, and oil & gas domains. I was part of both operations and development agile scrum teams. 

Currently I work for Carbon Compute Platform at Lowe's India as Lead Software Engineer and previously worked for Honeywell India as Software Engineer II.

I strongly believe in minimalist and have wide range of interests that includes HomeLab (Playing around with few of my raspberry Pis :P), Internal developer tools, Full-stack frontend, backend technologies and Infrastructure engineering. 

When Iâ€™m not debugging, youâ€™ll probably find me playing badminton/volleyball, chess or exploring new places/traveling.
